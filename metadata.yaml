description: Splendid sequel to author's 1902 classic, How the Other Half Lives. Compelling
  real life tales, accompanied by rare photographs and engravings, report on the status
  of living conditions among New York City's poor and exploited, including successful
  efforts to demolish breeding grounds of crime, improve conditions in schools, tenements
  and on playgrounds; and the removal from power of Boss Tweed and the Tammany organization.
  Of vital interest to anyone concerned with urban renewal and the plight of the city's
  poor at the turn of the century. -- Publishers description.
